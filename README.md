# ðŸ§  Pi-hole + Grafana Networking Project

![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

This project aims to turn a Raspberry Pi into a network monitoring and DNS filtering device using **Pi-hole**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**. The goal is to block ads at the DNS level and visualize network activity in real time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Set up **Pi-hole** to act as a DNS-level ad blocker.
- Configure **Prometheus** to collect network metrics.
- Use **Grafana** to visualize collected data.
- Document the full setup and configuration process step by step.

## ðŸ§° Stack / Technologies

- **Raspberry Pi 3B +**
- **Pi-hole**
- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana**

## ðŸ”§ Project Status

ðŸš§ Work in progress. This README will be continuously updated as installation and configuration steps progress.
